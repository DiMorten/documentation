Remote Sensing  data have been increasingly applied to assess agricultural yield, production and crop condition. These images can be obtained by different types of satellite sensors. Agricultural crop behavior can be modeled from a sequential multi-temporal perspective. Because of this, image data from previous months provides useful information for the crop type semantic segmentation task. In this context Deep Learning has emerged as a powerful technique for image sequence modeling using Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) recurrent neural networks. This work presents a methodology for satellite image crop recognition using a ConvLSTM approach based on a sequence of multitemporal, multispectral images. To assess the usefulness of this model, its results are compared with a basic LSTM approach. Experiments were carried out in a dataset from Ipua municipality in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. It is shown that ConvLSTM is a useful tool for semantic segmentation task based on spatio-temporal information in terms of overall and average accuracy.
