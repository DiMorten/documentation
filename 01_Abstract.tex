With population and food consumption continuously growing, the past years have seen an increased demand for efficient agricultural crop monitoring systems. Crop dynamics are inherently complex and require both spatial and temporal dynamics to be modeled for adequate mappings. The increasing availability of timely, precise and cost-effective Remote Sensing data makes it ideal for these type of systems, allowing to perform multi-temporal analysis. On the other hand, deep learning techniques have made great breakthroughs in multiple areas such as computer vision. This work performs a comparative analysis over some of the most promising deep learning architectures for the task of multi-temporal crop recognition: Fully convolutional and recurrent networks. Experiments were carried out in a temperate region near Hanover, Germany and a sub-tropical region with more complex temporal dynamics in Campo Verde, Brazil. Results show that the implemented models are state-of-the-art.
