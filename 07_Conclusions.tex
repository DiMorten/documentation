\section{Conclusions}

In this work, some of the most relevant deep learning architectures for multi-temporal crop recognition were implemented; tailored to the specific dataset requirements and compared. Furthermore, a new architecture based in ConvLSTM was proposed. Model performance was assessed over two study very different datasets located in Hanover, Germany and Campo Verde, Brazil. Results indicate that the abilities to represent spatial semantics from FCN-PC might be better harnessed in areas with larger crop tile sizes like the ones from Campo Verde. Likewise, the spatio-temporal modeling properties from ConvLSTM might be more relevant for datasets with larger time sequences. Future works will focus in combining both architectures into a fully convolutional recurrent network.
