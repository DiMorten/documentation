%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:

% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.

% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix



% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.


\usepackage{amssymb}

% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\begin{abstract}

Remote Sensing  data have been increasingly applied to assess agricultural yield, production and crop condition. These images can be obtained by different types of satellite sensors. Agricultural crop behavior can be modeled from a sequential multi-temporal perspective. Because of this, image data from previous months provides useful information for the crop type semantic segmentation task. In this context Deep Learning has emerged as a powerful technique for image sequence modeling using Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) recurrent neural networks. This work presents a methodology for satellite image crop recognition using a ConvLSTM approach based on a sequence of multitemporal, multispectral images. To assess the usefulness of this model, its results are compared with a basic LSTM approach. Experiments were carried out in a dataset from Ipua municipality in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. It is shown that ConvLSTM is a useful tool for semantic segmentation task based on spatio-temporal information in terms of overall and average accuracy.

\section{Introduction}
Agriculture must strongly increase its production to feed the nine-billion people predicted by mid-century, while minimizing its enviromental impact. In this context, precise and efficient information about the state of different crops can be used to develop commercial plans, regulate internal stocks and to perform customized management decisions based on varying soil types, landscape position and land usage history. In the last years, remote sensing imagery has increasingly been used for this task because it is a cost-efficient means for gathering timely, detailed and reliable information over large areas with short revisit periods \cite{thenkabail2015land,leite2011hidden}.

Crop recognition is challenging because some fields are covered with different types of crops during the year and such sequence could be governed by phenological, ecologic or economic reasons. Thus, agricultural areas are characterized by their temporal dynamics and also by their typical spatial patterns \cite{lohmann2008multi,waske2009classifier}. 

A commonly used method consists of stacking the multi-temporal sequence of images together and train a classifier such as RF or SVM using information from the individual pixels. This approach has the disadvantage that it ignores spatial context. Object-based approaches perform segmentation on the input data and classify the resulting segments. Although segmentation considers the image's spatial context, it only takes into account the input data and ignores the semantic information. Probabilistic graphical such as Conditional Random Fields are able to capture spatio-temporal context and have been used for crop recognition \cite{achanccaray2017spatial}, although it still requires features to be manually extracted. In recent years, deep learning models have made breakthroughs in several fields such as speech recognition and medical image processing. In the field of remote sensing, deep learning models have become a new way to solve old problems and have achieved state-of-the-art in multiple applications \cite{ji20183d, cr}. In particular, recurrent networks are designed to model temporal data while convolutional networks are useful for understanding spatial context. In \cite{jose}, recurrent and convolutional networks were successfully applied to crop recognition. Likewise, fully convolutional networks have became state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation tasks while improving computational efficiency at test time \cite{laura}.

When using multi-temporal image data for classification, a model that takes spatial and temporal dependencies into account is desired. Long short term memory (LSTM) models are known to be able to model temporal data. In the other hand, convolutional neural networks (CNN) are known to model spatial relationship between pixels from an image. As a  mixture of these models, convolutional LSTM networks (ConvLSTM) are able to model both spatial and temporal dependencies by replacing the LSTM’s original input, output and forget gate equations with convolutions \cite{convlstm}. This work implements a ConvLSTM-based neural network to address the problem of crop classification with multi-temporal satellite images. Its performance is evaluated in terms of overall and average accuracy metrics, as well as a comparison with a basic LSTM-based model.  

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II explores related work. Section III briefly explains the theoretical fundamentals required to understand the model. Section IV explains the proposed methods including the dataset preparation method, proposed network architecture and the comparison strategies. Section V defines the experimental protocol. Then results are discussed in Section VI. Finally, conclusions are presented in Section VII.

\section{Fundamentals}

\subsection{Long Short Term Memory (FC-LSTM)}

Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are a type of neural network designed for processing sequential data. These type of models are state-of-the-art in temporal modeling tasks\cite{ma2017ts}. In particular, LSTM are a special type of RNN that are capable of modeling both long and short term time dependencies. They feature two recurrent states $c_1,...c_t$ and $h_1,...h_t$ to store past information. Besides, they use an information gate to control how much information is added to the output state in each step and a forget gate to eliminate unuseful information. Input for this model is a sequence of vector data $x_1,...x_t$, and output is the $c_1,...c_t$ sequence. Equations for this model are as follows \cite{convlstm}, where "$\circ$" denotes the Hadamard product:
\begin{align*}
& i_t=\sigma (W_{xi}x_t+W_{hi} h_{t-1} + W_{ci}\circ c_{t-1}+b_i) \\
& f_t=\sigma (W_{xf} x_t+W_{hf} h_{t-1} + W_{cf}\circ c_{t-1}+b_f) \\
& C_t=f_t\circ C_{t-1}+i_t\circ tanh(W_{xc} x_t+W_{hc} h_{t-1}+b_c) \\
& o_t=\sigma (W_{xo} x_t+W_{ho} h_{t-1} + W_{co} \circ c_{t}+b_o) \\
& h_t=o_t\circ tanh(c_t)
\end{align*}

\subsection{Convolutional Long Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM)}

A ConvLSTM takes the original LSTM cell and replaces the fully connected layers from the forget, information and output gates with convolutions. Input $\mathcal{X}_1,...\mathcal{X}_t$, hidden state $\mathcal{H}_1,...\mathcal{H}_t$ and output $\mathcal{C}_1,...\mathcal{C}_t$ are sequences of images (As opposed to flat vectors from LSTM). The desired amount of filters corresponds to the amount of image bands from $C_t$. Equations for the ConvLSTM cell are as follows \cite{convlstm}, where "$\ast$" denotes the convolution operator and "$\circ$" the Hadamart product:
\begin{align*}
& i_t=\sigma (W_{xi} \ast \mathcal{X}_t+W_{hi} \ast \mathcal{H}_{t-1} + W_{ci} \ast C_{t-1}+b_i) \\
& f_t=\sigma (W_{xf} \ast \mathcal{X}_t+W_{hf} \ast \mathcal{H}_{t-1} + W_{cf} \ast C_{t-1}+b_f) \\
& C_t=f_t\circ C_{t-1}+i_t\circ tanh(W_{xc} \ast \mathcal{X}_t+W_{hc} \ast \mathcal{H}_{t-1}+b_c) \\
& o_t=\sigma (W_{xo} \ast \mathcal{X}_t+W_{ho} \ast \mathcal{H}_{t-1} + W_{co} \circ C_{t}+b_o) \\
& \mathcal{H}_t=o_t\circ tanh(C_t)
\end{align*}

\section{Models}

This section describes the models evaluated during this work. Image stacking (IS) has been widely used for multitemporal crop recognition \cite{schneider2012monitoring,schneider2008compact}. Because of this, IS was used as the baseline model. Two recurrent network architectures were tested: \textit{LSTM-PC} and \textit{ConvLSTM-PC}. These two architectures output a single classification for the entire patch. Then at inference time, the predicted value is assigned to the center pixel position from the corresponding input. Finally, a Fully Convolutional Network for full patch labeling (\textit{FCN-PL}) was used.

\subsection{Image Stacking with Random Forest}

This method consists of computing hand-crafted features for the images for each time step and stacking them all together, obtaining a feature vector from each pixel location. The resulting representation is then used to train a Random Forest classifier that assigns the class label probabilities for a given pixel. Particularly the values of correlation, homogeneity, mean and variance from GLCM matrix in four directions (0, 45, 90 and 135 degrees) using 5x5 windows were used as hand-crafted features. 
\subsection{LSTM-PC}

The model architecture is shown in Figure \ref{fig:baseline_model}. It receives a sequence of flattened image patches as inputs. First, the sequence is passed through a basic LSTM cell. Then the feature vector from the cell's last output is passed to a fully connected layer, followed by a softmax layer producing the output class probabilities. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{figs/baseline_rnn.eps}
\caption{Block diagram for the baseline model. Input is a sequence of flattened images with dimensions $(time steps\times height\times width, channels)$. Then the last output from the LSTM is taken to a fully connected layer, and finally a softmax layer is applied.}
\label{fig:baseline_model}
\end{figure}

\subsection{ConvLSTM-PC}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{figs/model.eps}
\caption{Block diagram for the proposed model. Input is an image sequence with dimensions $(time steps, height, width, channels)$. After the ConvLSTM cell, the sequence's last image is selected with dimensions $(height, width, channels)$ and taken to a fully connected layer, followed by a softmax output layer (ConvLSTM filters: 32).}
\label{fig:proposed_model}
\end{figure}

ConvLSTM-PC architecture is shown in Figure \ref{fig:proposed_model}. It begins with a ConvLSTM cell, which takes a time sequence of multi-spectral patch images as input. After this cell, the sequence's last image is selected and flattened. The resulting vector is taken to a fully connected layer by a softmax layer which produces the final class probabilities. 

\subsection{Fully Convolutional Network (FCN-PL)}

The FCN-PL architecture takes an image as input and produces an output of the same size with class probabilities for every pixel, using a series of down-sampling followed by up-sampling layers \cite{long2015fully}. In this work, the DenseNet architecture from \cite{iandola2014densenet} was used. This architecture uses skip connections to improve the flow of information and gradients throughout the network, allowing the use of larger models.

\section{Experiments}
\subsection{Datasets}

Agricultural behaviour can greatly vary in different regions. Because of this, two areas with very different weather conditions were studied: First one is located in the surroundings of Hanover city, in Germany (Figure \cite{}). It has an extension of 1728 km2 and consists of a sequence of 24 pre-processed, dual-polarized Sentinel-1 SAR images taken from from October 2014 to October 2016 in a monthly basis. Because this is a temperate region, each parcel belongs to the same class throughout the entire year. Most common crop types are Sugarcane, Soybean and Maize \cite{bargiel2017new}.

Second area is located in Campo Verde municipality from the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil with an extension of 4782km2 (Figure \ref{}). It consists of a sequence of 14 pre-processed, dual-polarized SAR images taken from Sentinel-1 between October 2015 and July 2016. Main classes are soybean, maize and cotton. This area is located in a tropical environment, making its multi-temporal behavior highly dynamic and challenging \cite{sanches2018campo}.



\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.22]{figs2/ClassOccurrencesUnique.eps}
\caption{Class occurences from Campo Verde dataset. Two main sub-sequences were identified: First one mainly contains Soybean, while the second one contains Maize and Cotton.}
\label{fig:labels}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Experimental Protocol}

In order to assess the influence of multi-temporal information for crop recognition, the last image from a given sequence was classified using past information from all the corresponding images in the sequence. 

In each of the studied areas, 50\% of the labeled data was used for training and the remaining 50\% for testing. Standard normalization was applied to the input images. In the case of Campo Verde database, two main sequences were separately studied due to their differences in crop distribution, which can be observed in Figure \ref{}. Sequence 1 consists of images taken from October 2015 to February 2016, while sequence 2 goes from March 2016 to July 2016. 

For the patch classification networks LSTM-PC and ConvLSTM-PC, the required amount of spatial information differed between the studied areas because of their specific crop parcel sizes. Input image size was 15x15 and 5x5 for Campo Verde and Hanover respectively. In the case of LSTM-PC, 100 filters were used for the recurrent network. In the fully connected network, 100 filters were used for Campo Verde and 300 for Hanover. Likewise, in ConvLSTM-PC the convolutional stage had 16 filters. Then the fully connected layer was configured with 100 filters for Campo Verde and 300 for Hanover. In the case of Hanover dataset, max-pooling was not applied due to its small input size. For FCN-PL, patches of size 32x32 were used as input. The DenseNet architecture was configured with a growth rate of 16 and a dropout of 0.2. Random forest for the IS model was trained with 250 trees and a maximum depth of 25.

Data balancing was performed with random replication from the smaller classes. Training was made with early stopping regularization. Adam optimizer with learning rate of 0.001 was used for the recurrent networks and Adagrad with 0.01 learning rate for FCN-PL.  

\section{Results}


\section{Conclusions}



Results show an improvement in all metrics for the implemented ConvLSTM model when compared against the baseline model. Metrics for both models are shown in Table \ref{tab:comparison}. Proposed model had a significant increase in average accuracy, and a slight increase in overall accuracy. The ConvLSTM cell managed to capture the dataset information with far less filters than the ones needed for the basic LSTM cell. On the other hand, the ConvLSTM cell with 16 filters had nearly the same amount of parameters than the BasicLSTM cell with 128 filters.

\section{Conclusions}

Convolutional LSTM cells are specially adapted to working with sequences of images, and the ConvLSTM-based model produced higher evaluation metrics than its basic LSTM counterpart. Using as little as 16 filters for the ConvLSTM cell was enough to outperform the baseline model which had 128 filters on the recurrent layer. Thus, an advantage of ConvLSTM models for this type of problem is the reduced amount of filters required to model the data behavior. Finally, as opposed to a basic LSTM cell, using a ConvLSTM cell outputs an image (or sequence of images), allowing to add further architectures on top of this layer such as fully convolutional networks. Future works will be focused in image-to-image architectures using ConvLSTM cells.

% From Figure~\ref{fig:sugarcane} and Figure~\ref{fig:corn}, it can be seen that there are improvements on the F1 measure of up to 76,4\% and 60,11\% for Sugarcane and Maize, respectively, when temporal information is considered. Notice the higher improvement on Maize than on Sugarcane, which is closely related to their F1 measure obtained by a monotemporal classification, where Sugarcane seems to be easier to discriminate than Maize due to the higher number of samples of it in each image. 

% Results for sugarcane and maize crops sequence classification from Ipu\~{a} dataset are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:sugarcane} and Figure~\ref{fig:corn}, respectively. Results for other classes are also shown due to they are not relevant for the application's purpose. Each figure shows, for different sequence length, the F1-Score values obtained by the methods evaluated after classifying the last image in the sequence. From left to right in each bar group, each bar corresponds to monotemporal classification, the traditional approach, single date, multi date and CNNs, respectively, where monotemporal classification refers to the classification of each image separately using RF. This kind of comparison allow us to analyze the contribution of temporal information to the classification performance.
%; however, this is not regularly increasing due to the lower number of samples in the other images (March and April), being Single layer CNNs the one with highest accuracy. 

% Regarding results of approaches based on DL techniques with respect to the traditional approach, it can be observed that majors improvements in the performance metric, for maize, occurs primarily when only one image is considered in the sequence (first group of bars in Figure~\ref{fig:corn}); around 10\% to 15\%, while for longer sequences are close to 3\%. When the sequence length increases, there is still accuracy improvements of DL approaches over the baseline; however, this is not regularly increasing due to the lower number of samples in the other images (March and April), being Single layer CNNs the one with highest accuracy.

% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
